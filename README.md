Project Idea: Password Protected Diary

Project Description: Our password protected diary app will allow users to keep their notes hidden from others who do not have access to their password. This will prevent others from accessing the user’s information without their knowledge by keeping contents of the app hidden behind a security measure. User’s will also be able to add new entries from their phones while also being provided with confidence in their information remaining private. By keeping entries stored only on the user’s device it will allow for all the information to be stored securely. The app will let users create and choose different profiles to maintain their notes separately.

Project Requirements:

1.As a new user, you can create an account to store your diary

2.When creating a new account, the user can select a username and password of their choice
3.The user can then log off from their account using a button on the right corner of the screen.
4.User can also make multiple accounts, but must log-off from an account before being able to login to another account.
5.Having a secure amount of password characters (make it required). Such as having 8-12 characters with numbers and symbols.
6.Entry Date and time written onto each entry
7.When creating a first diary, select the theme preferred, later u can change it.
8.When the user is logged in to their profile they can add new entries, and view the previous entries they have created
9.Entries will be limited to text only (can add images or other files possibly)
10.Users can change the size and color of the text
11.The user has to be logged in to access features like adding new entries and note saving. 
12.When writing a note, the user will only see the note and a small tab at the top of the app with elemental settings (to keep the design minimalistic)
